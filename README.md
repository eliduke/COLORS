# COLORS!

I'm a little colorblind all my friends &amp; family make fun of me for it, and I wanted my first [RubyMotion](http://rubymotion.com/ "RubyMotion - Ruby for iOS") iOS App to be fun and at least slightly practical. With each tap of your finger this app loads a random color that can then be compared to a color in real life.

Happy Tapping!
