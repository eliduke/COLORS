# COLORS!

I'm a little colorblind and I wanted my first [RubyMotion](http://rubymotion.com/ "RubyMotion - Ruby for iOS") iPhone App to be fun and at least slightly practical. With each tap of your finger, this app loads a random color with each tap that can then be compared to a color in real life.

Happy Tapping!
